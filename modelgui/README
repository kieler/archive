  Installation Instructions and Documentation
  -------------------------------------------

  Read the ModelGUI RTWiki page at http://rtsys.informatik.uni-kiel.de/wiki
  for installation and usage instructions.

  
  Compilation Instructions
  ------------------------

  To provide an easy-to-use compiling process, ModelGUI comes with the
  build tool Apache Ant. Actually, Ant is a platform independent and Java
  based variant of tools like make, gnumake, nmake, jam, and others. See
  http://ant.apache.org for further informations about Apache Ant.
   
  Just run 
     
      ./build.sh
 
  on a unix shell to see a list of available targets. For example you can run

      ./build.sh build

  to compile the java sources. Have fun!
