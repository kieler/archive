/**
 * A FocusContextEffect implements the Focus & Context behavior for graphical models for their diagrams
 * in the KIELER View Management.
 * After creating the effect, it allows to add semantical {@link EObject}s to the <b>focus</b>. These
 * elements will be shown with most detail. Other objects will form the <b>context</b> and will be shown
 * with the least detail. Currently full detail means that all compartments of the element are
 * expanded while less detail means that all compartments get collapsed.
 * <p>
 * In the future this could be extended to also support multiple levels of focus and/or context
 * and even different ways of reducing the level of detail. This could include complete
 * hiding of elements (i.e. use only a subset of elements as the context to reduce overall size
 * of a model) or to hide text labels, e.g. at connections or nodes.
 * <p> 
 * Next to an object added to the focus it can be specified how many containment levels of this
 * particular object should be added to the focus, e.g. none, all (i.e. adding the complete
 * children hierarchy of this object) or a specific level.
 * <p>
 * In opposite to the children hierarchy the parent hierarchy is always added completely for one element.
 * Therefore for one element, all of its ancestors will be added to the focus. Only after the
 * whole focus has been set, this transitive focus gets calculated and the context will be set as
 * its complement.
 * <p>
 * This class implements {@link IEffectCompound} as it is composed out of many 
 * {@link CompartmentCollapseExpandEffect}s and in future may also contain other effects. While
 * an {@link IEffectCompound} itself is no {@link IEffect}, it can be asked for a list of
 * the primitive effects by {@link #getPrimitiveEffects()}. An {@link AbstractCombination} is able
 * to schedule an {@link IEffectCompound} just like it can schedule an {@link IEffect}. However, 
 * this is just some convenience function to schedule all primitive effects successively.
